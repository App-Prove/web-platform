> Where your favorite app get its security proved

AppProve is a auditing platform, for IT Technologies. We help developers get their apps' security checked and proven by robust tests. ( pen testing, UX/UI audits, ...).

We gather a huge panel of freelancer and big auditing firms auditors to ensure diverse auditing conclusion.

- Freelancers get the chance to monetize their coding knowledge
- Big Auditing Firms get a place where they can earn contracts with big tech companies. (and ones to come)

> Clients/Developers can prove their app's security with a certificate and audit review

## Why we decided to build AppProve

After working for big auditing firms, we decided to leave to start our own business.
We built our first software, but didn't have enough "credit/history" neither budget to earn the interest of big auditing companies.

Alongside this entrepreneurial journey, we realized we had no proof of our everyday software's security.
That's where started our mission to normalize software audits.

## Who we are?

We are engineers, financial experts, entrepreneurs... We seek for transparency, trust, affordability and experience.
